We didn’t want force anyone to follow our’s understanding.

We decided not to bring architecture that will hit the newspaper’s covers but architecture which will fit the area, and situation where is it going to be developed. Following to this thought the philosophy that guided us through the design process was to bring structure, which will be made by locals for locals.", imgbw:"Akonkurs2czb-min.jpg", img:"Akonkurs2kolor-min.jpg"  , scheme: "konkursPeacePavillion_optimized.jpg"}
